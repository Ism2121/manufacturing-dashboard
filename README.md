# manufacturing-dashboard
A simple manufacturing dashboard designed to provide insight into shop effeciency and production performance.

# Goal
The goal of this project is to strengthen my skills in Excel, SQL, and Tableau by building a basic end-to-end workflow:
Raw data -> Cleaning -> SQL analysis -> Tableau dashboard
This is also a starting point for future development of a service tool aimed at improving reporting and decision-making for small manufacturing shops. 

# Tools Used
 - Excel
 - SQL
 - Tableau

# Dashboard
The dashboard will include:
 - Cycle time trends
 - OCE-style cycle reporting
 - Effeciency by part number
 - Downtime and bottleneck analysis
